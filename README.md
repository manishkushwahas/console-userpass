# console-userpass mini project
**what is console-userpass?
It is console based program which takes to user a username and password and shows as to user there details at the end of program execution.**

## Purpose of this mini-project
**This project is made only to learn how the asterick show in console during the input takes. Basically i wanted to know what is the logic and behind the scene (also called Password Masking:*****) hidden the password if user entered during execution of program.**

### What I learned 
- Learned python syntax
- Familiar with Modules
- Logic in the program

## To Run this program in your system You Need
1. Python should installed in your system
2. Need necessary modules
   - msvcrt (This is microsof visual c run time py module)
   - sys (python module for interacting to interpeter and it's environment)
3. IDE my favourite: VS CODE
4. Patience to understand the low level code and High level code
5. Familiarity with python syntax

#### Most interesting line of code without flush() asterick dose not shows
code: `sys.stdout.flush()`
    - `"".join(buf)` #### it concats the all entered password together.
